# Tableau-Projects
These are my Tableau Projects I've been uploading at https://public.tableau.com/profile/hrishikesh.telang

## Customer Distribution, Sales and Profit Margin Dashboard
My first dashboard represents customer distribution, total sales, and profit margin sales of Europe through the years 2011 to 2014. I implemented the concept of maps, scatter plot, and using the concept of highlighting to add to more effect. 

## Storyline of the business outlook of a sample Superstore across all US States
Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’. You are the business owner of the retail firm and want to see how your company is performing. You are interested in finding out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. What all business problems you can derive by looking into the data?

## Discount Mart
Discount mart is a small supermarket owned by a salesman. He wants a dashboard where he can track how well Discount Mart is doing for this year (in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity Sold). He would also like to know how well categories are performing as well as different regions. The salesman assumes that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order but would like this confirmed by the data. He also noted that Profit is 30% of the selling price.

## Green Destinations (HR Analytics)
Green Destinations is a well known travel agency. The HR Director has recently noticed an increase in employees leaving (attrition). She would like to figure out any trends or patterns. She has surveyed the staff of Green Destinations and provided you with the data. She would like to know what the attrition rate is (% of people who have left). She would also like to know if factors like age, years at the company and income play a part in determining if people will leave or not.
